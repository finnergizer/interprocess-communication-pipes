approach:
when creating stations; duplicate process 4 times; if child process, then modify pipes to be pointed at appropriate locations; if parent, point read and transmission pairs to appropriate pipe endpoints;

use stn() in child process, map stdin and stdout appropriately

createStation
===============
fork, then call exec

4 processes are created in the createStations; 4 pipes to manage the transmission from stn to hub
NOT SURE ABOUT THIS??????4 threads are created to transmit the messages; 4 pipes to manage the transmission from hub to all stn


fdsRec is the fdescriptor used by the station to receive messages... (i.e. standard in)
fdsTran is the fdescripter used by the station to transmit messages...
See listenTran
We have 8 pipes

each station will have two pipes managed by a single thread
